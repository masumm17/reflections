When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When collaborating with others, have backup, show my works to other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
While working on a feature or bug fix, a single commit might not sufficient to make the repo publicly displayable. So if each commit were automatically pushed/pulled it might be possible to public incomplete codes.
